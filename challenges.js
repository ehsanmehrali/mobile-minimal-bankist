// Coding Challenge #1
// Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.
// Your tasks:
// Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
/*
const dogsJulia = [9, 16, 6, 8, 3];
const dogsKate = [10, 5, 6, 1, 4];
// checkDogs(dogsJulia, dogsKate);
// 1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters)

// 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
const allDogsAge = dogsJulia.concat(dogsKate);
console.log(allDogsAge);

// 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂")
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// Test data:
// . Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// . Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

// Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if dogs are eating too much or too little.
